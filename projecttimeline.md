## üß† Project Description  

The **Live Sampler** is an interactive, browser-based music tool that allows users to **record, trigger, and manipulate live audio samples** in real time. It is designed for performers, producers, and sound artists who want a lightweight, creative way to capture and remix sounds during live sessions or improvisation.

The sampler will let users record short clips from their microphone, load existing audio files, and trigger them using virtual pads or a MIDI controller. Users can loop samples, adjust pitch, and apply effects like delay, reverb, or filtering ‚Äî all in real time.  

The goal is to provide an **intuitive live sampling environment** that bridges the gap between DAWs and live performance tools.

## üéØ Objectives and Scope  

### Objectives
- Develop a working live sampler that can:
  - Record and trigger audio samples
  - Loop and trim sample playback
  - Apply real-time audio effects (delay, filter, reverb)
  - Respond to MIDI input
- Build an efficient, low-latency Web Audio architecture
- Design a simple, visually clear interface for live use

### Scope
This project will focus on real-time sampling and playback functionality.  
Advanced sequencing, tempo sync, or multi-layer effects will not be included in this first version.  

Stretch goals:
- Save/load sample banks
- Waveform visualization
- Pad customization (color, name, etc.)
