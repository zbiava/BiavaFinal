## Project Description

The **Live Sampler** is a simple browser-based app that lets users **record, load, and play back short audio clips** in real time. It‚Äôs designed for musicians and producers who want an easy way to capture and trigger sounds during live performance or experimentation.

Users can record sounds from a microphone, assign them to pads, and play them back instantly. The app will include basic controls for playback, looping, and effects like delay or filter.
